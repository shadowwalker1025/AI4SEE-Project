Requirements:
 pc/laptop with min 8gb ram
 android studio for emulators(android/ios/ipad/tabs)
 vscode (preffered)/atom/sublime
 node
 knowledge about js,reactjs
 


To install React Native, you can follow these steps:(preffered 2)

1)Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can check if Node.js is installed by opening a terminal(cmd) window and typing node -v . If Node.js is not installed, you can download and install it from the official 
website: https://nodejs.org/ (choose suitable version)

2) two ways to develop react apps :
         To use you react-native cli  can follow these steps :
    1)Install React Native CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal:
        npm install -g react-native-cli
    2)Once the installation is complete, you can create a new React Native project by running the following command:
    react-native init myproject
    This command will create a new directory named myproject in your current directory, which will contain the basic files and folders        required for a React Native app.
3)Navigate into the project directory by running the following command:
cd myproject
4)Now you can start the development server by running the following command:
npm start
This will start the Metro bundler, which is responsible for compiling your code and serving it to your app. You should see a QR code in your terminal window.
5)Install and run your app on a device or emulator by running one of the following commands in a new terminal window:
# for iOS
react-native run-ios

# for Android
react-native run-android
These commands will build your app and deploy it on a connected device or emulator.

That's it! You should now have a working React Native app. You can start modifying the files in the myproject directory to build your own app.

 2)expo cli (faster than ractive-native)

 To use Expo CLI, you can follow these steps:
1)Install Expo CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g expo-cli
2)Once the installation is complete, you can create a new React Native project by running the following command:
  expo init myproject
This command will create a new directory named myproject in your current directory, which will contain the basic files and folders required for a React Native app, as well as the Expo configuration files.
3)Navigate into the project directory by running the following command:
  cd myproject
4)Now you can start the development server by running the following command:
expo start
This will start the Expo development server, which will open a web page with a QR code and a list of options.

6)Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device from the app store.

7)Scan the QR code in the web page using the Expo Go app, and your app should open on your device.

That's it! You should now have a working Expo app. You can start modifying the files in the myproject directory to build your own app, and see the changes live on your device as you save them.
